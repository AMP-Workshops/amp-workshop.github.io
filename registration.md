## Author Registration

The following information is WIP as this page is currently under construction.

Accepted papers of AMP 2024 will be published in the post-conference
proceedings. Therefore, **one** of the authors of an accepted paper will have to
register for ICSOC 2024:
- For *full papers* (up to <del>eight</del> nine pages, including references)
the registration fee is $TBA.
- For *short papers* (up to <del>five</del> six pages, including references) and
*extended* *abstracts* (up to <del>two</del> three pages, including references),
the registration fee is $TBA.

Next to the cost for the publication, the above fees include a
complementary registration to ICSOC 2024 for *one* author. Please let the workshop
organizers know the name of the author that will benefit from the complementary
registration by sending us an e-mail. You can find our email addresses on the
[Committees](../committees/) page.

If a paper has multiple authors, other authors need to directly register at the
standard conference price via
the [registration form on the ICSOC website](https://icsoc2024.redcad.tn/index.html).

## Non-Author Registration

Regular workshop participants can register via the
[registration form on the ICSOC website](https://icsoc2024.redcad.tn/index.html)
for the complete ICOSC conference, which also includes access to AMP 2024.
