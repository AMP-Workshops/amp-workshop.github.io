### Abstract

The digitalization of the energy sector is a transformation process to support
the decarbonization of the energy system. One of the big challenges for the
digitalization in the energy system is the connectivity to edge devices (e.g.
e-mobility, heat pumps, PV, etc) for different vendors. Therefore
interoperability between different edge devices, back-end systems, and local
energy management components is important. In the Horizon 2020 project
interconnect interoperability between such smart devices in the energy sector
will be examined. Therefore standardized communication protocols will be used
and edge devices will be certified to prove compatibility with the standard.
Here we will present a microservice-based certification platform to enable
certification in agile software development processes.
