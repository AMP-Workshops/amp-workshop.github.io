### Abstract

Blockchain (BC) presents a feasible method to persist immutable information in a
distributed ledger to improve the level of authentication and trust. Moreover,
smart contracts enable the automated execution of any contract concluded between
participants of the Blockchain network. On the other hand, Microservice
Architecture (MSA) is a novel approach towards service-based scalable
applications. In our paper, we present an agile approach based on Model-Driven
Engineering (MDE) that aims to facilitate the integration process of Blockchains
into MSA-based applications in order to benefit from the advantages attributed
to Blockchains.
