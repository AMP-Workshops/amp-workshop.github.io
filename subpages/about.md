Scope
----------------------------
The AMP workshop aims at collecting experiences on microservices adoption, reporting best practices, but also specially failure cases, so as to build community knowledge based on previous errors and successes. The workshop is open to experience reports from practitioners and academia. The fifth edition of AMP aims to continue the success of its previous editions from 2020 to 2023.

We seek to collect original work on the science and engineering of programming microservices, including but not limited to evolutionary and agile architectures, methods and tools, patterns, operational practices and DevOps, agile teams, programming languages and techniques for microservices, software quality aspects, metrics and software analytics, verification, test-driven approaches and testing, architectural refactoring, empirical studies and experience reports on microservices adoption and teaching.
